### TIL Things I Learned
-----

- this was a great project that involved many practical programming skills like conditionals, asynchronous functions, and manipulating arrays.
- practiced using the array `.map` and `.filter` methods in React components.
- gained a stronger understanding of React hooks like `useEffect`. 
- how to set up and use a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) site, eg. Firebase.
- yet more practice with plain CSS!
